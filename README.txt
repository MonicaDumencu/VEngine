Basic voxel engine.

This project was created as part of group project at Newcastle University, Computer Game Engineering Master. It only includes the procedural terrain generation. For full project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G9i_GGXYII.

The video for this demo can be seen at: http://youtu.be/dmFbjiWI2tI

The terrain setup method has been modified in the game, to make it playable, but in the video it can be seen how complicated it can be. For the game, I also worked on the collision detection and response for the terrain, as well as the networking, along with one of the other team members.
