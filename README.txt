Basic voxel engine.

This project was created as part of group project at Newcastle University, Computer Game Engineering Master. It only includes the procedural terrain generation. For full project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G9i_GGXYII.

The video for this demo can be seen at:

The terrain setup method has been modified in the game, to make it playable, but in the video it can be seen how complicated it can be. For the game, I also worked on the collision detection and response for the terrain, as well as the networking, along with one of the other team members.
